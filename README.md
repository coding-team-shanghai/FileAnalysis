# FileAnalysis
The purpose of the repo is probably known to all --- insufficient disk space.
It's coded in C++.
By using the app, you can find the largest files in your system.

-------------------------------
Known bug:

1. If you scan 20000+ files at one time, you will see an fatal error which is displayed.

2. If you scan C:/ without granting the .exe file with admin previllage, we can't scan the drive.
